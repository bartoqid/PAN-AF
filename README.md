# PAN_DUG
Dynamin User Group code for Palo Alto Networks devices

This solution allows assigning devices into dynamic user groups (by MAC address) so that static DHCP addressing is not required to consistently enforce security policies.

After attaching your Raspberry Pi to your WiFi, you can install this solution by pasting the following onto the command line:

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/p0lr/PAN_DUG/master/install.sh

chmod 755 install.sh

./install.sh
